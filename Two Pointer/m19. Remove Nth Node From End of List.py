# Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

# Example:

# Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

# After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
# Note:

# Given n will always be valid.

# Follow up:

# Could you do this in one pass?
